# Macbeth Act 5

## Scene 1
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.


                                                            I have two nights watched with you but can
                                                            perceive no truth in your report. When was it she
                                                            last walked?

  Since his Majesty went into the field, I
have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown
upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,
fold it, write upon ’t, read it, afterwards seal it, and
again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast
sleep.

  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at
once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of
watching. In this slumb’ry agitation, besides her
walking and other actual performances, what at any
time have you heard her say?

                                                            That, sir, which I will not report after
                                                            her.

  You may to me, and ’tis most meet you
should.

  Neither to you nor anyone, having no
witness to confirm my speech.


                                                            Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,
                                                            upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

                                                            How came she by that light?

                                                            Why, it stood by her. She has light by
                                                            her continually. ’Tis her command.

  You see her eyes are open.

  Ay, but their sense are shut.

  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
her hands.

  It is an accustomed action with her to
seem thus washing her hands. I have known her
continue in this a quarter of an hour.

  Yet here’s a spot.

  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes
from her, to satisfy my remembrance the more
strongly.

                                                            Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.
                                                            Why then, ’tis time to do ’t. Hell is murky. Fie, my
                                                            lord, fie, a soldier and afeard?
                                                            What need we fear
                                                            who knows it, when none can call our power to
                                                            account?
                                                            Yet who would have thought the old man
                                                            to have had so much blood in him?

                                                            Do you mark that?

  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is
she now? What, will these hands ne’er be clean? No
more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that.
                                                            You mar all with this starting.

                                                            Go to, go to. You have known what you should
                                                            not.

                                                            She has spoke what she should not,
                                                            I am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has
                                                            known.

  Here’s the smell of the blood still. All
the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. O, O, O!

                                                            What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely
                                                            charged.

                                                            I would not have such a heart in my
                                                            bosom for the dignity of the whole body.

                                                            Well, well, well.

                                                            Pray God it be, sir.

  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have
known those which have walked in their sleep,
who have died holily in their beds.

  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.
Look not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo’s
buried; he cannot come out on ’s grave.

                                                            Even so?

  To bed, to bed. There’s knocking at the
gate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your
hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed, to
bed, to bed.Lady Macbeth exits.

                                                            Will she go now to bed?

                                                            Directly.

 
Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all. Look after her.
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think but dare not speak.

  Good night, good doctor.
They exit.


## Scene 2
Drum and Colors. Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus,
Lennox, and Soldiers.


 
                                                            The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
                                                            His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
                                                            Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
                                                            Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
                                                            Excite the mortified man.

                                                            Near Birnam Wood
                                                            Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.

 
                                                            Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

                                                            
                                                            For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file
                                                            Of all the gentry. There is Siward’s son
                                                            And many unrough youths that even now
                                                            Protest their first of manhood.

                                                            What does the tyrant?

                                                            
                                                            Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
                                                            Some say he’s mad; others that lesser hate him
                                                            Do call it valiant fury. But for certain
                                                            He cannot buckle his distempered cause
                                                            Within the belt of rule.

                                                            Now does he feel
                                                            His secret murders sticking on his hands.
                                                            Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
                                                            Those he commands move only in command,
                                                            Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
                                                            Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe
                                                            Upon a dwarfish thief.

                                                            Who, then, shall blame
                                                            His pestered senses to recoil and start
                                                            When all that is within him does condemn
                                                            Itself for being there?

                                                            Well, march we on
                                                            To give obedience where ’tis truly owed.
                                                            Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal,
                                                            And with him pour we in our country’s purge
                                                            Each drop of us.

                                                            Or so much as it needs
                                                            To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
                                                            Make we our march towards Birnam.
                                                            They exit marching.


## Scene 3
Enter Macbeth, the Doctor, and Attendants.


 
Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
“Fear not, Macbeth. No man that’s born of woman
Shall e’er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false
thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures.
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got’st thou that goose-look?

  There is ten thousand—

  Geese, villain?

  Soldiers, sir.

 
Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

  The English force, so please you.

 
Take thy face hence.
Seyton!—I am sick at heart
When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough. My way of life
Is fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf,
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
                                                        I must not look to have, but in their stead
                                                        Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath
                                                        Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare
                                                        not.—

 
What’s your gracious pleasure?

  What news more?

 
All is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.

 
I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hacked.
Give me my armor.

  ’Tis not needed yet.

  I’ll put it on.
Send out more horses. Skirr the country round.
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine
armor.—
How does your patient, doctor?

  Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies
That keep her from her rest.

  Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

  Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

 
Throw physic to the dogs. I’ll none of it.—
Come, put mine armor on. Give me my staff.
Attendants begin to arm him.
Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the thanes fly from
me.—
Come, sir, dispatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo
That should applaud again.—Pull ’t off, I say.—
                                                        What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug
                                                        Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of
                                                        them?

 
Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

  Bring it after me.—
I will not be afraid of death and bane
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.

, aside 
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.
They exit.


## Scene 4
Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff,
Siward’s son, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, and Soldiers,
marching.


 
                                                            Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
                                                            That chambers will be safe.

                                                            We doubt it nothing.

 
                                                            What wood is this before us?

                                                            The Wood of Birnam.   

 
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear ’t before him. Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.

                                                            It shall be done.

 
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down before ’t.

                                                                                                        ’Tis his main hope;
                                                                                                        For, where there is advantage to be given,
                                                                                                        Both more and less have given him the revolt,
                                                                                                        And none serve with him but constrainèd things
                                                                                                        Whose hearts are absent too.

                                                                                                        Let our just censures
                                                                                                        Attend the true event, and put we on
                                                                                                        Industrious soldiership.

  The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate;
Towards which, advance the war.
They exit marching.



## Scene 5
Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and
Colors.


 
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be
ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
A cry within of women.
What is that noise?

 
It is the cry of women, my good lord.He exits.

 
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
Cannot once start me.

Wherefore was that cry?

  The Queen, my lord, is dead.

  She should have died hereafter.
There would have been a time for such a word.
                                                Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
                                                Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
                                                To the last syllable of recorded time,
                                                And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
                                                The way to dusty death.
Out, out, brief candle!
Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.

Thou com’st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.

  Gracious my lord,
I should report that which I say I saw,
But know not how to do ’t.

  Well, say, sir.

 
As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought
The Wood began to move.

  Liar and slave!

 
Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so.
Within this three mile may you see it coming.
I say, a moving grove.

  If thou speak’st false,
Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.—
                                                    I pull in resolution and begin
                                                    To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,
That lies like truth. “Fear not till Birnam Wood
Do come to Dunsinane,” and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—
                                                    If this which he avouches does appear,
                                                    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I ’gin to be aweary of the sun
And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now
undone.—
Ring the alarum bell!—Blow wind, come wrack,
At least we’ll die with harness on our back.
They exit.


## Scene 6
Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and
their army, with boughs.


 
Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down
And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do,
According to our order.

  Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.

 
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
They exit.
Alarums continued.


## Scene 7
Enter Macbeth.


 
They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What’s he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

  What is thy name?

  Thou ’lt be afraid to hear it.

 
No, though thou call’st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.

  My name’s Macbeth.

 
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.

  No, nor more fearful.

 
Thou liest, abhorrèd tyrant. With my sword
I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.

  Thou wast born of
woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandished by man that’s of a woman born.
He exits.

                                                    
                                                    That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
                                                    If thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,
                                                    My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
                                                    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
                                                    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,
                                                    Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
                                                    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
                                                                            By this great clatter, one of greatest note
                                                                            Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,
                                                    And more I beg not.He exits. Alarums.

 
This way, my lord. The castle’s gently rendered.
The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.

  We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

  Enter, sir, the castle.



## Scene 8
 
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.


  Turn, hellhound, turn!

 
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back. My soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.

  I have no words;
My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out.Fight. Alarum.

                                                        Thou losest labor.
                                                        As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
                                                        With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
                                                        Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
                                                        I bear a charmèd life, which must not yield
                                                        To one of woman born.

  Despair thy charm,
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee Macduff was from his mother’s womb
Untimely ripped.

 
Accursèd be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cowed my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That palter with us in a double sense,
That keep the word of promise to our ear
And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.

  Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.
We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted upon a pole, and underwrit
“Here may you see the tyrant.”

  I will not yield
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet
And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damned be him that first cries “Hold! Enough!”
They exit fighting. Alarums.

 
                                                        I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

 
                                                        Some must go off; and yet by these I see
                                                        So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

 
                                                        Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

                                                        
                                                        Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.
                                                        He only lived but till he was a man,
                                                        The which no sooner had his prowess confirmed
                                                        In the unshrinking station where he fought,
                                                        But like a man he died.

                                                        Then he is dead?

                                                        
                                                        Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
                                                        Must not be measured by his worth, for then
                                                        It hath no end.

                                                          Had he his hurts before?

 
                                                        Ay, on the front.

                                                        Why then, God’s soldier be he!
                                                        Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
                                                        I would not wish them to a fairer death;
                                                        And so his knell is knolled.

                                                        
                                                        He’s worth more sorrow, and that I’ll spend for
                                                        him.

                                                        He’s worth no more.
                                                        They say he parted well and paid his score,
                                                        And so, God be with him. Here comes newer
                                                        comfort.

 
                                                        Hail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands
                                                        Th’ usurper’s cursèd head. The time is free.
                                                        I see thee compassed with thy kingdom’s pearl,
                                                        That speak my salutation in their minds,
                                                        Whose voices I desire aloud with mine.
                                                        Hail, King of Scotland!

  Hail, King of Scotland!Flourish.

 
We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you.
My thanes and
kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honor named.
What’s more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen
(Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands,
Took off her life)—this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of grace,
We will perform in measure, time, and place.
So thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
Flourish. All exit.
